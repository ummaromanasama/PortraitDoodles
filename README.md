Status: Ongoing

Summary: This program gernerates dots from the uploaded photograph to connect essentially mimicing connect the dots puzzel. The portraits.py file calculates the. distances between the points of each permutation combonation and searches for the shortest path using the traveling salesman problem. Once the shortest path is found, the points are plotted and connected.

Problem: The terminal kills my program after being run for a while.
