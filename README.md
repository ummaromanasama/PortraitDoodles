# PortraitDoodles

Status: Ongoing

Summary: This program generates dots from the uploaded photo to connect, essentially mimicking the connect the dots puzzle. The portraits.py file calculates the distances between the points of each permutation combination and searches for the shortest path using the traveling salesman problem. Once the shortest path is found, the points are plotted and connected. The file testFile.py is a version of portraits.py that doesn't take in an image.

Problem: The larger number of dots I input the longer the terminal takes to compute everything. Eventually, the terminal kills my program.
